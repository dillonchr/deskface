## Usage
This is very dependent on __ImageMagick__ and right now it's only tested on Win64. I don't plan to do much with this project because it's been working for many months now. It would be fun to rewrite in Python or CLJS but I have yet to begin either. Someday!

## TODO
* find cleaner way to diff images and get results
* decouple magick command line
* find a way to streamify everything :tada:
